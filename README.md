What is DMS?
---------------------

The main task of Documentchain is to store document information for a tamper-proof document revision. DMS is the project-own coin used to pay the storage fees.

DMS is an experimental digital currency forked from Dash. DMS Core is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.
