What is Documentchain (DMS)?
---------------------

The main task of Documentchain is to store document information for a tamper-proof document revision. DMS is the project's own coin used to pay transaction fees and serves as a general crypto currency.

DMS is an experimental digital currency forked from Dash. DMS Core is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.
